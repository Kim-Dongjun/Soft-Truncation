# Soft Truncation: A Universal Training Technique of Score-based Diffusion Model for High Precision Score Estimation

This repo contains an official PyTorch implementation for the paper [Soft Truncation: A Universal Training Technique of Score-based Diffusion Model for High Precision Score Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05527).

--------------------

We propose a genearlly applicable training method for a general weighted diffusion loss.
